A machine can never know how to answer this question. It can try to provide the most probable answer through statistics,
but never based on the meanings of the sentence. When applied to social structures, social constellations, identity
categories, power structures and dependencies, these decisions weigh heavily. Hidden behind the machines are
manifestations of the values of their creators, which could not be more opaque for the users. In collaboration with
Cynthia Schemidt.
