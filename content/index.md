Fernando Obieta is a conceptual media artist and artistic researcher. His artistic work and research focus  on the critique and reflection of (digital) media, artefacts, systems, services, and solutions and how they are contingent and situated. He is currently doing his PhD in <i>media theory</i> funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation's (SNSF) Doc.CH program. The dissertation "The Contingency of Design – a critique" is an investigation how a feminist ethics and morality of machines and their production could be constituted. To this end, he is working on a series of posits under the title "machines congregating", in which he examines how different machines perceive people and how people observe others (or themselves) through machines.
